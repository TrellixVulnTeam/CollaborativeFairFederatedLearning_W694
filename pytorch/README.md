## This is dedicated to pysyft and pytorch for fair and private FL.

### Example on MNIST
- [x] CNN
- [x] Shapley value using test acc
- [ ] Shapley value using val acc
- [ ] Shapley value using cosine similarity between gradient updates
- [ ] Random sampling the sequences of workers
- [ ] Optimization for iteration through individual worker data: either randomly sample batches or organized iteration
