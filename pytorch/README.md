## This is dedicated to pysyft and pytorch for fair and private FL.

- [ ] Add in no-pretrain model directly, to avoid repeated re-run of pretrain = 0
- [ ] Add in other datasets to test MLP
- [ ] Communication efficiency consideration
- [ ] Heterogenuous models setting for predictions allocation on a public validation set
- [ ] Imbalanced class numbers setting


### Example on MNIST
- [x] CNN
- ~~[x] Shapley value using test acc~~
- ~~[ ] Shapley value using val acc~~
- ~~[ ] Shapley value using cosine similarity between gradient updates~~
- ~~[ ] Random sampling the sequences of workers~~
- ~~[ ] Optimization for iteration through individual worker data: either randomly sample batches or organized iteration ~~
